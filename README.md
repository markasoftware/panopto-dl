# panopto-dl

The simplest and most reliable panopto-dl tool you'll find on github. To use, you need to download a cookie file from your browser in netscape format (I recommend "cookie manager" extension for firefox). Then, be sure to navigate to the dedicated panopto page (not embedded in canvas or anything like that), and copy the host and folder ID from the url bar as suggested in the help text.
